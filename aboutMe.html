                <br>
                <u>Early Life</u><br>A first generation from the Philippines at the age of 4 and raised in Toronto. I grew up playing tennis and basketball until I became introduced to building cars and computers!.
                <br>
                <br>
                Top 3 shows: Billions, Suits & House of Cards <br> <br>
                <u>Transitions</u><br>I've been a part of many types of workplace environments.<br>
                <br>I first started working in the exciting and creative atmosphere of a new, local tech startup company based in Toronto. <br> <br>
                During my next stage, I experienced the hustle and bustle that went on at a multinational conglomerate.<br><br>
                Recently, I explored into finding work at a government agency. <br><br>
                I'm a big believer in experiencing as much as one can, and that doesn't just apply to travelling the world. <br><br>
